<p style ="font-size:20px;"> Travelling gives me a good opportunity to learn a lot about the history of the country I visit, to see cultural and historical places, to meet people of different nationalities, to learn a lot about their traditions, customs and culture. In other words. I can expand my worldview and my mind.</p>
